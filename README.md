# Simple Task List Application (By Louis)

# Project Description
 This is command-line application that allows users to add tasks, view tasks and mark tasks as completed.
 As an added bonus, users are also able to:
   1. Delete Tasks
   2. Have sorting of their tasks via (Task ID, Due Date or Completeness) in ascending or descending order.
   3. Colour Coding of tasks within the list, green for completed tasks and red for pending tasks.
   4. Summary table of the count of total tasks, completed tasks and pending tasks.
   5. Text wrapping of name of tasks that may be too long to fit within the column of the table

# How to use
  1. Run the visual studio solution in the file.
  2. Enter the commands as listed and instructed in the menu.

# Testing
  Currently a Work-In-Progress as of 20th August 2025 0500hrs. (Deadline give was by 20th August, therefore I am submitting this proof of work for now)
  Due to the nature of this project being a command-line application with user inputs and outputs, I am currently researching on various libraries that would suit the testing feasibility of the application.
  Ideally, I want to find a framework that is similar to Playright or Cypress in the context of Web App Development, which will allow me to test the application from End-to-End(E2E).
